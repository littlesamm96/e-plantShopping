# E-Plant - Where green meets serenity!

The frontend shopping application where users can browse a variety of houseplants and add them to a shopping cart. The shopping cart feature enables users to view all of their items and their total cost. Your shopping cart should also allow users to adjust the number of items in their cart before checkout. 

The application has three pages: a landing page, a product listing page, and a shopping cart page.

The landing page should have the following elements:
- A background image
- A paragraph about the company
- The company name
- A Get Started button linking to the product page

The product listing page should have at least six houseplants for sale, organized into three or more categories. Each plant should have the following details about it:
- A thumbnail image
- Plant name
- Price
- An Add to Cart button

The product listing and shopping cart pages should have a header. The header should have a shopping cart icon with a number that updates dynamically, displaying the total number of items in the cart. The header should also contain navigation to either of the other pages, depending on which page you are on.

The shopping cart page displays all the details about the items in it. It should prominently display the total number of plants in the cart, the total cost of all items in the cart, a continue shopping button, and a checkout button. On this page, you should be able to see each type of plant in the shopping cart, including its thumbnail and name. You should also display its unit price and the total of all the items in the cart. You should provide an increase or decrease button to change the number of that plant type in the cart, which also updates the shopping cart icon in the header and the total number of items in the cart. Finally, you should also include a delete button for each type of plant in the cart.
